<h1>Mo Mo</h1>
    <p>Momo “म:म:” unanimously is the unofficial national dish of Nepal. This Nepali dumpling which comes in various shapes, sizes and with all kinds of fillings is a household name in many parts of Nepal. With simple recipes contrasting to the delectable taste, Momo is the go-to meal for any period of the day. Momo is more than a dish in Nepal; it is a way of life.The word Momo is said to be originated in ancient Tibet but the Nepali Momo has established a unique identity of its own. Like any other type of dumpling, it is a meat or vegetable filling wrapped in a dough. It is bite-sized and usually served with dipping sauce. Chicken, Veg, and Buff Momos are the most common kinds of Momo in the country but other kinds are available too. Due to its massive consumption, Momo has evolved to become a fast food in Nepal</p>

<h2>Lists of Instructions</h2>
 <ol>
   <li>To make the dough, tip the flour and a pinch of salt into a bowl. Add the oil to the flour and combine well with your hands. Slowly add 100ml water and knead the dough until it is stretchy. Cover with cling film and leave the dough to rest.</li>
   <li>Tip all the filling ingredients into a bowl and season with salt. Use your hands to combine thoroughly.</li>
   <li>Divide the dough into 20 balls (each should weigh about 15g). Dust your work surface with flour and roll the balls into thin circles using a rolling pin</li>
<li>Spoon about 1 tsp filling in the centre of one circle, then use your thumb and forefinger to pinch together an edge of the dough into a fold</li>
<li>Continue to pinch along the edge of the circle and work your way all the way round.</li>
<li>Bring all the pinched edges of the circle together to cover the filling and twist the top to seal it. Repeat with the rest of the dough and filling.</li>
<li>Fill a bamboo steamer with water, layer the base with baking parchment and pierce some holes in it.</li>
<li>Working in two to three batches, place the momos on the baking parchment and steam for 10 mins. They should look transparent and not feel sticky when fully cooked. Keep warm while you steam the rest</li>
<li>While the momos are steaming, mix all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl with 2 tbsp water. Serve the hot momos with the sauce for dipping.</li>
